VM
Optimizations:
  - push/pop instructions that can push/pop N registers at a time
Devices:
  - I/O
    - Register to write a char
    - Register to write begin of string pointer, register to write length, flushes on length write
    - Register to ask if a char is ready on stdin
    - Register to perform a blocking read of stdin
  - Graphics
    - ....
UI:
  - Give a map of (identifier,location,type) triples, in the RAM viewer, right aligned grey text ("faded out") for names of memory locations
  - When decoding an instr, check the symbol table and if there is a match use that label
  - If memory location is an int, display in base 10, if a ptr, display in base 16 etc.

Bugs:
  multu 0xFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF is broken, because javascript can't multiply things.
